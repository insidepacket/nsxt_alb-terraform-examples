The above example is based on the following environment:
Two DCs: site01 and site02;
There is a controller cluster in each site;
Two GSLB sites configured: site01 is the leader site.
Terraform v0.12
NSX Advanced load balancer: v18.2.9.


The Terraform plan will create the following resources:

(1) Five web servers as a pool member in each DC;
(2) Two local load balancing pools in each DC: the first 2 web servers are members of pool1 and the rest 3 web servers are members of pool2;
(3) A pool group in each DC, which includes the above 2 pools: pool1 is In Service and pool2 is Out of Service
(4) A virtual service in each DC to provide local load balancing
(5) SSL profile in each DC to define how a SSL session is terminated on the NSX advanced load balancer;
(6) HTTP Cookie-based persistence profile in each DC to offer web session persistence in the local load balancing;
(7) Certificate and Key for the web application HTTPS service;
(8) A HTTP health monitor in each DC to check the health of local load balancing pool members
(9) Global load balancing PKI profile;
(10) Global load balancing health monitor;
(11) Global load balancing persistence profile;
(12) Global load balancing service including site affinity;
